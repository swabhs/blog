This ACL was great. Though I spent quite some time preparing/changing my own talk, I still managed to attend some really great talks by others.

I also tweeted a bunch during the conference. Don’t know if it’s a great thing, but I made friends with a few NLP stalwarts thanks to my Twitter activity. Particularly Hal Daumé (who retweeted me, yay!) re. And the day after, he came to my talk - hope he liked it. Speaking of which, here’s his own blog post about ACL and the talks he liked.

Overarching themes: Distributional semantics was a big thing this year. This could be subjective, based on the sessions and talks I attended.

Finally, this ACL was a strong indicator that the community is thinking about gender diversity. We’re lucky as NLP researchers to have more women interested, but there are still milestones to achieve. ACL encouraged a lot of women speakers.

I met a lot of great women in NLP - Sharon Goldwater, Emily Bender, Animashree Anandkumar and had one of the best brainstorming sessions with Yejin Choi. Personally, it makes a big difference to me when I see these great women, because I can relate to them and it reaffirms my faith in my own decision to join this field. It was so fun watching them nerd out about their favorite topics(something I kind of miss about CMU, everyone is always nerding  it out).

Day 1 [Aug 8th]

-Keynote Talk #1 [Amber Boydstun] Framing in politics and statistical analysis of change in public opinion based on agenda-driven speech. The challenge presented to the NLP audience was the following: can we automatically detect these trends? Got me thinking - we are barely scratching the surface of what can be potentially useful applications for humanity as a whole. So much potential for NLP, yay for the future.

————————————— Session 1 —————————————

-Noise reduction and targeted exploration in imitation learning for Abstract Meaning Representation parsing
[James Goodman, Andreas Vlachos and Jason Naradowsky]

Rollin and rollout. I’m glad they selected AMR parsing. SEARN and Dagger-style algorithms for doing similar kinds of search during training and testing.

-Generalized Transition-based Dependency Parsing via Control Parameters
[Bernd Bohnet, Ryan McDonald, Emily Pitler and Ji Ma]

This talk I’m completely blanking out on. #todo: read abstract and possibly the paper to summarize.

-Learning the Curriculum with Bayesian Optimization for Task-Specific Word Representation Learning
[Yulia Tsvetkov, Manaal Faruqui, Wang Ling, Brian MacWhinney and Chris Dyer]

Instead of having a random order of examples, learn the best order from samples provided. This is curriculum learning, where the curriculum is controlled by specific hyper parameters, which are learnt using Bayesian optimization.

They demonstrate results on multiple tasks, including parsing, which is cool and not seen so often.

-Named Entity Recognition with Bidirectional LSTM-CNNs (TACL)
[Jason P.C. Chiu and Eric Nichols]

Boring.

————————————— Session 2 ——————————

-Active Learning for Dependency Parsing with Partial Annotation
[Zhenghua Li, Min Zhang, Yue Zhang, Zhanyi Liu, Wenliang Chen, Hua Wu and Haifeng Wang]

This I’m blanking out on.

-Morpho-syntactic Lexicon Generation Using Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning (TACL)
[Manaal Faruqui, Ryan McDonald and Radu Soricut]

Started with a small sample lexicon and extended it to a large corpus using projection. Seems practically useful.

-News Citation Recommendation with Implicit and Explicit Semantics
[Hao Peng, Jing Liu and Chin-Yew Lin]

Went to check out the newest ARK member, he seems to be doing very well, he’s prepared for what’s to come!

-Document-level Sentiment Inference with Social, Faction, and Discourse Context
[Eunsol Choi, Hannah Rashkin, Luke Zettlemoyer and Yejin Choi]

Theories about relationships between entities, like friends of enemies are enemies, were empirically justified from text data. Involved complex annotation schemes and guidelines (I annotated!)

————————————— Session 3 ——————————

-Multilingual Projection for Parsing Truly Low-Resource Languages (TACL)
[Željko Agić, Anders Johannsen, Barbara Plank, Héctor Martínez Alonso, Natalie Schluter and Anders Søgaard]

Same style of projection as was used by Dipanjan and others at Google.

-Combining Natural Logic and Shallow Reasoning for Question Answering
[Gabor Angeli, Neha Nayak and Christopher D. Manning]

clever trick which he proved using a sample logic puzzle, nice talk

-Many Languages, One Parser (TACL)
[Waleed Ammar, George Mulcaire, Miguel Ballesteros, Chris Dyer and Noah A. Smith]

may be not really low resource, as per Emily Bender

-Unsupervised Part-Of-Speech Tagging with Anchor Hidden Markov Models (TACL)
[Karl Stratos, Michael Collins and Daniel Hsu]

anchor HMMs, good but do the properties generalize?

-Multi-lingual dependency parsing evaluation: a large-scale analysis of word order properties using artificial data (TACL)
[Kristina Gulordava and Paola Merlo]

the talk was painful to watch

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Day 2 [9th Aug]

Keynote talk #2 [Mark Steedman]

Collocational vs denotational paradigms of distributional semantics.

Collocational semantics is what word vectors are all about.
Denotational semantics equates to logical semantics, building knowledge graphs, etc.

—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Day 3[10th Aug]

—————— Outstanding Papers Session I and II ————————

-A Thorough Examination of the CNN/Daily Mail Reading Comprehension Task
[Danqi Chen, Jason Bolton and Christopher D. Manning]

Simple methods for reading comprehension work, so the work involved detailed analysis of the dataset to show patterns in the data that kind of undermine the task.

-Learning Language Games through Interaction
[Sida I. Wang, Percy Liang and Christopher D. Manning]

Learn from interaction rather than supervision. Outlined the necessity of better user interaction to teach machines well, the users who gave consistent commands taught the systems better, even if it was not in a real language.

-Finding Non-Arbitrary Form-Meaning Systematicity Using String-Metric Learning for Kernel Regression
[E.Dario Gutierrez, Roger Levy and Benjamin Bergen] {WON best paper award}

Correlations between word meaning and word form. These seem arbitrary at first glance, but actually follow patterns in the corpus. Specially interesting are phonaesthemes. Used distributional models to confirm local phono semantic hypotheses. The mapping is found using supervised learning, non-parametric kernel regression, in particular.

-On-line Active Reward Learning for Policy Optimisation in Spoken Dialogue Systems
[Pei-Hao Su, Milica Gasic, Nikola Mrkšić, Lina M. Rojas Barahona, Stefan Ultes, David Vandyke, Tsung-Hsien Wen and Steve Young] {WON best student paper award}

Instead of just awarding static rewards, learn the rewards to associate with different methods.

-Globally Normalized Transition-Based Neural Networks
[Daniel Andor, Chris Alberti, David Weiss, Aliaksei Severyn, Alessandro Presta, Kuzman Ganchev, Slav Petrov and Michael Collins]

Feed-forward nets with global normalization obviate the need for looking forward into the rest of the sentence(dump the buffer).

Joan Bresnan

Got the lifetime achievement award. Cutely nerded out about Bantu languages. Garden to bush- not my favorite analogy, but anyway. Answered a question saying “I don’t know” - so much easier to admit than to go around the bush. Snubbed Jason Eisner, it was hilarious. Her talk outlined how statistical methods became mainstream in linguistics

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Day 4[10th Aug]

Representation Learning Workshop : Snuck into this one for the excellent line-up of keynote talks
Keynote Talk #3
[Katrin Erk]

Keynote Talk #4 Tensor decompositions to learn sentence embeddings
[Animashree Anandkumar]

Properties which do not hold in two dimensions, hold in three. Non-convex optimization.

Keynote Talk #5 Learning representations
[Hal Daumé III]

CoNLL
Keynote Talk #6 Disfluency detection by humans
[Fernanda Ferreira]

Fascinating talk. I’m a big sucker for anything involving language and human psychology - so I was on the edge of the seat for this one. I even managed to embarrass myself - I went up to the speaker after her talk and started rambling about how this could be an argument in favor of left to right parsers

————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Day 5[11th Aug]

Keynote Talk #7 RNNaissance
[Jürgen Schmidhuber]

Grand talk, started with a history of neural nets and the LSTM, cited a lot of previous work and ended with grand promises of artificial intelligence leading to singularity 😃 Interestingly, the name long short-term memory comes from biological short-term memories.

-Exploring Prediction Uncertainty in Machine Translation Quality Estimation
[Daniel Beck, Lucia Specia1, Trevor Cohn]

-Learning when to trust distant supervision: An application to low-resource POS tagging using cross-lingual projection
Meng Fang and Trevor Cohn

❤️ Greedy, Joint Syntactic-Semantic Parsing with Stack LSTMs
Swabha Swayamdipta, Miguel Ballesteros, Chris Dyer, Noah A. Smith

My talk went pretty well, actually. Had quite a large attendance and a fun question-answering session.

-Beyond Prefix-Based Interactive Translation Prediction
[Jesús González-Rubio, Daniel Ortiz Martinez, Francisco Casacuberta, Jose Miguel Benedi Ruiz]

Had a strange claim : instead of translating as the sentence is seen from left to right, this work claimed that interactive translation quality is better when the entire sentence is seen.

-Cross-Lingual Named Entity Recognition via Wikification
[Chen-Tse Tsai, Stephen Mayhew, Dan Roth]

At the end of the day, I snuck into the open discussion at the Word Vector evaluation workshop. Felix Hill opened that session with a long description of the questions he believed the community should be discussing. The most interesting(very subjectively) that was brought up was the lack of shared tasks, which has spurred development in other communities. I think most people agreed with the need to continue this workshop over the next few years.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some talks I missed out on:

- Kiperwasser and Goldberg : Bilstm for features of words, then mlp of head/modifier to score possible dependency attachment.  MST on top.  Also used in greedy incremental parsing. Nice results.
- Zhang and Weiss : The stack-propagation paper in the same session, by Zhang and Weiss, is also interesting.  Could imagine this being useful in syntax/semantics models (they applied it to POS/syntax).
- Rashkin, and Choi :
